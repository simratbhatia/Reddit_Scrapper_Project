Comment,Sentiment
"This subreddit discusses all levels of tennis, from tour professionals to recreational players.",Positive
Djokovic d. Dimitrov 6-4 6-3,Neutral
"Djokovic just hammered away at the Dimi backhand all day. Including hitting unusually high heavy top to the Dimi backhand, not his normal shot trajectory, so must’ve been part of his specific gameplan today. It worked. Those ate Dimitrov up. I felt the futility, poor guy.",The sentiment is neutral.
Ah the classic Nadal vs. Fed strategy lol,The sentiment expressed in this statement is lighthearted amusement.
It's just the most effective strategy against the 1hbh no matter what its apologists try to argue: it's a liability every time you face a same-peer opponent.,Neutral
Played with strong one handers like Wawrinka or Thiem or Gasquet (despite his other shortcomings) have no trouble with it.,Positive
"Including hitting unusually high heavy top to the Dimi backhand, not his normal shot trajectory, so must’ve been part of his specific gameplan today.",The sentiment expressed in this statement is positive.

This is the second time Djokovic has won Roland Garros and the Paris Masters in the same year.,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
Next year Olympics in Paris hopefully,Optimistic
He really REALLY  wants Olympic gold.,Positive
"I wonder if the pressure gets to him, I mean he’s played in 4 Olympic Games now, all of them narrow misses. He’s won everything now, I wonder if that pressure is only existing in the Olympics",The sentiment of this statement is one of empathy and concern.
"He won't lose it this rime around. Every single player on the tour is terrified of him, he just needs to show up.",Positive
They said that in 2021 and 2016,Neutral
10th overall title in Paris. Not too bad,Positive
Novak has lost only 1 match on hardcourt all season lol,The sentiment of this statement is amusement.
"Saving one match point against Korda, and one against Carlos.",Neutral
Both championship points as well,The sentiment of this phrase is neutral.
Easy best of all time stuff,Positive
"I have seen enough, Medvedev is the goat for giving this beast his only hardcourt loss",Positive
Yeah it took a resurgence hard-court beast like Meddie to took Novak out.,Positive
"5 losses in this entire year: 1 on Hard, 3 on Clay and 1 on Grass.",Neutral.
Undefeated since his loss against Alcaraz at Wimbledon. Novak things.,Positive
"People were saying it was the end of Novak and was a ""new era""(Nike openly stating this in their ad campaign) lol",The sentiment of this statement is skeptical.
“Passing of the torch” lmao,The sentiment of this phrase is amused sarcasm.
Novak passed the torch from his right hand to his left hand.,neutral
He would probably still win with his left hand,Positive
"Lmao Novak after going down two sets in next years Wimby final - ""There is something you should know: I am not right handed.""",Comical.
People really thought he was done after that lmfao.,Amused.
"If you went by some people's comments, you'd think Alcaraz straight setted him with bagels and breadsticks instead of just barely getting the win in an insanely competitive match.",The sentiment expressed in this sentence is one of admiration.
Yeah I saw all of that. Got a lot of updoots on those too.,Positive
"True lol. The level Alcarez got to in those 3 sets he won was probably best he's played all year as well, he wasn't going to be able to sustain that form.",The sentiment of this statement is positive.
"A note to add. It was just Nike doing its thing, when Alcaraz was asked about the start of his era he clearly answered that No era is starting until Novak and Rafa retire.",Neutral
"To be fair, I think Alcaraz is brilliant and my comment wasn’t a knock on him, more just on the narrative on here and social media after that match",The sentiment in this statement is positive.
Maybe we should ignore social media and their claims because according to them Shelton could win US open. Everyone on social media pretends to be a tennis expert.,Skeptical.
"Wimbledon final was an uncharacteristic performance from novak, he looked a bit like a ""mental midget"", the wind really seems to get to him lmao. Make no mistake though this man is still imperious and I think the only thing that will stop him is father time.",The sentiment is slightly negative but generally positive.
"It was 100% the wind, Alcaraz, while he played great, was super lucky the roof happened to be open on that day (was raining like 3 days in a row prior).",The sentiment in this statement is one of surprise but also admiration.
"I disagree, if he wins Wimbledon, the pressure to win USO to complete the CYGS would have been stifling. Personally I preferred Novak losing Wimbledon and winning USO to complete his revenge tour.",Neutral
"I don't think so because he's already had the experience of going for the CYGS in 2021. With that experience I think it wouldn't get to his head. It's also somewhat similar to getting #23 and finally passing Fedal, that's also insane pressure but he did it.",The sentiment of this statement is positive.
he wouldn't have had the fairly easy draw if he was seeded no 1 for the uso after winning wimby. Still a good chance he wins,This sentiment is neutral.
4 of each. Yes please.,Neutral.
"I love Novak as much as anybody else but to say it was 100% wind and Carlos was just lucky is just bollocks. Yes, Novak came ridiculously close to basically sealing the win in that tiebreak but he didn't.",The sentiment of this statement is disagreement.
Are you fr? Wimbledon is an outdoor tournament. Give Credit where it's due.,The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
"He gets credit for it, yet at the same time he was also still lucky that out of the 90% of the days it was raining, it wasn't raining on that particular day because Novak is much better indoors and Carlos is much worse. Both of these things can be true.",Neutral.
"Indoor grass is not the same as Indoor hard, we don't have definite data to conclude that. Also, I mean, with a player of Novak's stature, him playing bad at a Wimbledon Final is his responsibility, it's not an excuse, and Novak himself wouldn't give that excuse. Every match Novak plays against Alcaraz is where Novak shows how seriously he takes Alcaraz.",Neutral.
Can you admit Novak was lucky to play Nadal with the roof closed at Wimby 2018 then?,Neutral.
"Absolutely, I thought he had it on the 5th set and gave it away!",Positive
"Which was always bullshit because the general level of tennis is so, so much higher than 10 years ago it is incomparable.",Negative
You think the level of tennis now is “incomparably higher” now than it was in 2012-2013?? What are you talking about?,The sentiment of this statement is disbelief.
"I remember all the Fedal fans in the post match thread crowing about how ""Novak's weak era farming is over and he'll never win anything again""","The sentiment expressed in this statement appears to be largely negative, with skepticism about Novak's continued success."
