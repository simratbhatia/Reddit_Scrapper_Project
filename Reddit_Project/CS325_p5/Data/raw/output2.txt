<div class="md"><p>I wish there was a way to know you are in the good old days before you leave them.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Seasons 2 to 5 are some of the best comedy ever made for TV. It does fall off eventually but those seasons aew just incredible. Endlessly rewatchable.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I rewatch the office basically every year</p>

<p>The show is just so much fun, I know people hate the last few seasons but I still love the finale episode and think the Florida Arc is hilarious </p>

<p>While not every episode after Michael leaves is a hit, if you enjoy the side characters many of them get more screen time and are great like Kevin and Darryl</p>

<p>It does suck they ruin Andy‚Äôs character but he does have that great line at the end of the show about the good old days, and almost makes up for it</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>yeh the first few episodes are really cringey with michael, glad it gets more comfortable after that</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Op, try Arrested development next. Also Fisk if you have ABC I View.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>season one is actually real gold üòÜ not easy to watch but rewarding for its unflinching look at how real things can be. but i understand it‚Äôs not for everyone. glad you found the show and got into it tho!!</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>S1 isn&#39;t even really the US office. It&#39;s quite a different show since it&#39;s the UK story/script.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>You like the office, which Mike Shur was a writer on. He left in season 5 to create Parks and Rec with the Office&#39;s (US) creator and show runner Greg Daniels, which you also liked. Look at Mike Shur&#39;s catalogue because he has created or written for some fantastic television.</p>

<p>Also Mike played Dwight&#39;s cousin Mose, so there&#39;s that</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Now go visit <a href="/r/DunderMifflin">r/DunderMifflin</a></p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>[deleted]</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a pretty clever show. One of my favorite episodes is &quot;Murder&quot;. That&#39;s comedy gold</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>As someone who never watched the show when it was on and decided to try it on Netflix a couple years ago I can honestly say it&#39;s one of the best shows ever created. If you&#39;re having a bad day throw on the office and it&#39;ll make it a little better.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Hell ya!</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Well said!</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>You may to go check out the diffrent versions of the office... Last time I checked I think there was 15 plus from around the world.</p>

<p>Turns out everybody knows a boss like David Brent/Micheal Scott/David Gervais</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s such a brilliant show for the most part, many modern day sitcoms are poorly written and hardly make me laugh, but this did. Just like peak simpsons, the writing is fantastic, and Steve Carell was perfect as Michael Scott. However it does just like every other show go downhill from season to season. I personally believe that Seasons 1 - 3 were peak of the show, and starting with season 4 the change is slowly becoming noticable. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Seasons 4 and 5 are still very enjoyable and have classic episodes like the Dinner Party one, but the writing for some episodes was mediocre at best. People say that the show went downhill after Michael leaves but it already did even when he was there. It was only after he left that they ruined Andy&#39;s character and taken out a lot of depth from all the characters. Show indeed is still watchable till the end and you can&#39;t expect a show to stay at its best for 9 seasons, it&#39;s just a shame I guess. This comment is very pointless, but I just felt like saying how I felt about the show sorry.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>The quality drops before Michael leaves. It‚Äôs as good as it gets for about three seasons. </p>

<p>I pinpoint it to about the time Erin arrives. Not all her fault but that signifies the shift in the comedy from dark to campy and silly. There are moments, dinner party for example. Also when Dwight mangles the CPR dummy.</p>

<p>Parks and Rec maintains the level throughout. The Office doesn‚Äôt unfortunately.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>As someone who spent years without finishing it after about season 5 I finally watched the rest of it and thought the post Michael Scott seasons were pretty decent, especially with James Spader who, while was pretty unrealistic in the scope of the show, had some incredible funny moments. </p>

<p>All that said I was really put off by Andy‚Äòs character development toward the end of the show. I feel like he started off as a goofy guy who the show had you kinda rooting for to be the next ‚Äúthis guy deserves to be happy‚Äù aka Jim character, only to turn him into a real shit character that just turns selfish and abusive completely out of left field. His transition I‚Äôm sure could be explained, but I felt like it happened so fast that it completely pulled me out of the show in those moments, and that‚Äôs taking into about James Spader calling himself the fucking lizard king, and that kinda making sense in its context.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>It dips after about season 5 and unwatchable after steve carrell leaves</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>After Seinfeld ended its run I thought there‚Äôd never be a show I find to be that funny again. And along came the office and I was hooked. Watched until Michael Scott left.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Halfway through season 1 happens to be when they started writing original episodes for the US version IIRC. I think I watched the whole series at least 3 times during quarantine. That, Peep Show, and P&amp;R :P</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>The Office was my COVID binge. I had seen the British version years ago. It was watchable but I didn‚Äôt love it. I was tired of missing out on references to the show from friends so I finally started it. I found the show much more enjoyable when they made Michael more likeable. Ellie Kempler is also think Ellie Kempler is super adorable.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Being a 34 year old, beer drinking Aussie bloke, I don&#39;t normally go for soppy rom com crap, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol what does drinking beer have to do with anything</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Also how ignorant are you to find this show <em>charming</em>  Everyone in that office was terrible, and Michael Scott was an incompetent racist piece of shit.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I love when people who ruined their lives having kids make these long rambling posts.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>nm</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>So should I get peacock or buy the blu ray collection. Because I&#39;ve rewatched The Office about 8 times now</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>The writers did Andy Bernard really dirty towards the end, but I&#39;m glad they gave him that line. After all the b.s. and love, he really delivered that line and it sticks.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>This one hurts.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Season 2 is incredible. There‚Äôs literally an episode that revolves around someone taking a shit on the carpet in Michael‚Äôs office lol</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>aew just incredible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, big Kenny Omega fan myself!</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I know you&#39;re excited, but let&#39;s not say things we can&#39;t take back...</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>think the Florida Arc is hilarious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any time I watch Dwight &quot;revving up&quot; in the hallway when Jim is trying to save his job, I laugh until I nearly piss myself.</p>

<p>Or Jim being murdered.</p>

<p>Or the bed bug discussion.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I know people didn&#39;t like Robert California, but I personally thought he had some of the funniest moments in the entire show. He was good as a one season character I think. Any more would have been too much.</p>

<p>&quot;Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Michael is a huge douche in season 1. Very unlikeable. But they changed his character to be more of a loveable idiot and it worked so well</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Yep; from what I remember in an interview, the writers realized that the tone of the original UK show just wasn‚Äôt playing all that well with American audiences. The Dundies (Season 2‚Äôs premiere) deliberately brought the characters outside the office so that other people - strangers - started shitting all over Michael. </p>

<p>It was an attempt to create a ‚Äúhey you can‚Äôt do that, only we do that‚Äù response in the characters and, in turn, the audience, and bring them back over to Michael‚Äôs side, if only by a little bit. From that point forward they tried to have at least a little bit of positivity or ‚Äúsilver lining‚Äù in each episode, to break up the cynicism and cringe.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Cheers mate, will do</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s mostly just the 1st episode, which is nearly a shot for shot remake</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>The first episode written specifically for the US version was when Michael had to pick a healthcare plan, episode 3, which is unique to Americans</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Will do! Thx.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Begone you seductive temptress! You tease me with these morsels of hope!</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>PARKOUR!</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Seasons 1-4 has Greg Daniels as the showrunner. The quality dropped significantly when Paul Lieberstein took over in season 5.</p>

<p>Seasons 2 and 3 are some of the best network comedy episodes ever but what came after was mediocre to terrible.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Also when Dwight mangles the CPR dummy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought this was awful</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say unwatchable, definitely not as good tho.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>You have high standards if you find the last two seasons of the Office unwatchable</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>It‚Äôs unfortunately how I‚Äôve felt watching it for the first time. I‚Äôm at the start of season 8 and have had no desire to continue. The drop in quality is quite substantial in season 7, but I‚Äôm at the point where I haven‚Äôt went back for months.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>It‚Äôs for verification purposes. If he didn‚Äôt mention the beer, how could we be sure he‚Äôs a real Aussie?</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Oi cunt, you must be fun at parties.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I love when people don‚Äôt keep their mouths shut and say shitty things.</p>

<p>Oh wait no I don‚Äôt love that. Please shut up.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Was gonna make the same joke about MJF</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Same! Full gear is gonna be nuts</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing to take back. I simply stated facts.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>The murder cold opening is always fun</p>

<p>Stanley also was great in those episodes</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>He is an interesting character </p>

<p>Hate how his arc ended it was gross and not funny but he was fun to watch for the lost part</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I usually love comedy TV. Recently started season 1 and I can&#39;t stand how Michael is such a prick in season 1. And the first 5-7 episodes are so cringy that I could barely watch them.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>AD is fantastic but you have to pay attention.  They go very hard on all forms of comedy, so you got sight gags, word play, sarcasm, call backs and heeps of subtilty on top of the just standard comedic fare. Its kinda like &quot;Airplane!&quot; in a sense because you sort of notice new things everytime you watch it.  </p>

<p>Oh and never watch the &quot;Netflix Seasons&quot; 4 &amp; 5.  Just stop at 3 and be happy.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Yup their main requirement was Gervais was the pilot should be shot for shot</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so, I&#39;m pretty sure It&#39;s most of the first season</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>you can find them for Parks and Rec too, the use to put them on Hulu as producers or directors cuts.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>So it was literally Toby‚Äôs fault. üòÇ</p>

<p>The Sabre and Robert California storylines were awful agreed.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Season 8 was VERY rough around the edges but still had some memorable episodes that I liked. Season 9 was a complete slog I only watched for completion/resolution that I will never again watch sans the finale which was okay.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>could be an irishman posing</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>You first.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Stick with it, parks and recreation was very rough its first season too then got incredible, same creator</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>Having seen both, the first episode is the only one that is the same between the US and UK versions. After the pilot, the storylines are completely different. But it&#39;s definitely true that the first season was trying to match the more bleak tone of the UK version, especially with Michael.</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>I believe your wrong</p>
</div>

<div class="md"><p>The thought crossed my mind, but there are a few subtle clues that tells you OP is Australian.</p>
