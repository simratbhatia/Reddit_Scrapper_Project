Djokovic d. Dimitrov 6-4 6-3
Djokovic just hammered away at the Dimi backhand all day. Including hitting unusually high heavy top to the Dimi backhand, not his normal shot trajectory, so must‚Äôve been part of his specific gameplan today. It worked. Those ate Dimitrov up. I felt the futility, poor guy.
Ah the classic Nadal vs. Fed strategy lol
It's just the most effective strategy against the 1hbh no matter what its apologists try to argue: it's a liability every time you face a same-peer opponent.
Played with strong one handers like Wawrinka or Thiem or Gasquet (despite his other shortcomings) have no trouble with it.
Including hitting unusually high heavy top to the Dimi backhand, not his normal shot trajectory, so must‚Äôve been part of his specific gameplan today.
Was never in doubt , odds of 1.01 easy
This is the second time Djokovic has won Roland Garros and the Paris Masters in the same year.
Next year Olympics in Paris hopefully
He really REALLY  wants Olympic gold.
I wonder if the pressure gets to him, I mean he‚Äôs played in 4 Olympic Games now, all of them narrow misses. He‚Äôs won everything now, I wonder if that pressure is only existing in the Olympics
He won't lose it this rime around. Every single player on the tour is terrified of him, he just needs to show up.
They said that in 2021 and 2016
10th overall title in Paris. Not too bad
Novak has lost only 1 match on hardcourt all season lol
Saving one match point against Korda, and one against Carlos.
Both championship points as well
Easy best of all time stuff
I have seen enough, Medvedev is the goat for giving this beast his only hardcourt loss
Yeah it took a resurgence hard-court beast like Meddie to took Novak out.
5 losses in this entire year: 1 on Hard, 3 on Clay and 1 on Grass. 
Undefeated since his loss against Alcaraz at Wimbledon. Novak things.
People were saying it was the end of Novak and was a "new era"(Nike openly stating this in their ad campaign) lol
‚ÄúPassing of the torch‚Äù lmao
Novak passed the torch from his right hand to his left hand.
He would probably still win with his left hand
Lmao Novak after going down two sets in next years Wimby final - "There is something you should know: I am not right handed."
People really thought he was done after that lmfao.
If you went by some people's comments, you'd think Alcaraz straight setted him with bagels and breadsticks instead of just barely getting the win in an insanely competitive match.
Yeah I saw all of that. Got a lot of updoots on those too.
True lol. The level Alcarez got to in those 3 sets he won was probably best he's played all year as well, he wasn't going to be able to sustain that form.
A note to add. It was just Nike doing its thing, when Alcaraz was asked about the start of his era he clearly answered that No era is starting until Novak and Rafa retire. 
To be fair, I think Alcaraz is brilliant and my comment wasn‚Äôt a knock on him, more just on the narrative on here and social media after that match
Maybe we should ignore social media and their claims because according to them Shelton could win US open. Everyone on social media pretends to be a tennis expert.
Wimbledon final was an uncharacteristic performance from novak, he looked a bit like a "mental midget", the wind really seems to get to him lmao. Make no mistake though this man is still imperious and I think the only thing that will stop him is father time.
It was 100% the wind, Alcaraz, while he played great, was super lucky the roof happened to be open on that day (was raining like 3 days in a row prior). 
I disagree, if he wins Wimbledon, the pressure to win USO to complete the CYGS would have been stifling. Personally I preferred Novak losing Wimbledon and winning USO to complete his revenge tour.
I don't think so because he's already had the experience of going for the CYGS in 2021. With that experience I think it wouldn't get to his head. It's also somewhat similar to getting #23 and finally passing Fedal, that's also insane pressure but he did it. 
he wouldn't have had the fairly easy draw if he was seeded no 1 for the uso after winning wimby. Still a good chance he wins
4 of each. Yes please.
I love Novak as much as anybody else but to say it was 100% wind and Carlos was just lucky is just bollocks. Yes, Novak came ridiculously close to basically sealing the win in that tiebreak but he didn't.
Are you fr? Wimbledon is an outdoor tournament. Give Credit where it's due.
He gets credit for it, yet at the same time he was also still lucky that out of the 90% of the days it was raining, it wasn't raining on that particular day because Novak is much better indoors and Carlos is much worse. Both of these things can be true.
Indoor grass is not the same as Indoor hard, we don't have definite data to conclude that. Also, I mean, with a player of Novak's stature, him playing bad at a Wimbledon Final is his responsibility, it's not an excuse, and Novak himself wouldn't give that excuse. Every match Novak plays against Alcaraz is where Novak shows how seriously he takes Alcaraz.
Can you admit Novak was lucky to play Nadal with the roof closed at Wimby 2018 then?
Absolutely, I thought he had it on the 5th set and gave it away!
Which was always bullshit because the general level of tennis is so, so much higher than 10 years ago it is incomparable.
You think the level of tennis now is ‚Äúincomparably higher‚Äù now than it was in 2012-2013?? What are you talking about?
I remember all the Fedal fans in the post match thread crowing about how "Novak's weak era farming is over and he'll never win anything again"
Guess he showed Nike, it‚Äôs still the Novak era.
Nike is a bitch ass, child labor company, remember the ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù ad with Rafa, the passing of the torch with Alcaraz ‚Ä¶. Hahaha they are bitter as fuck for Nole rejecting them a bunch of times.
They all use child labor. Most produced products do
Dimitrov simply did not play at a high enough level to beat Djokovic. He needs to improve his returns.
Meanwhile me, diarrhea at 32 and tied to my bed for 2 days
Same though üò≠ people on Twitter were complaining that Djokovic took a bathroom break after the second set against Rublev‚Ä¶ Like, did they forget the guy is playing with a bad stomach
Exactly. I think the man has earned the right to take a mid match dump lol
my mans must have sniffed some parisian chocolat on his way to the stadium
man dimi is still crying it's heartbreaking üíî
yes, considering how Rublev said yesterday ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to play him again,‚Äù Novak‚Äôs broken their hope‚Äôs a bit
source please?
https://tennisuptodate.com/atp/i-dont-want-to-play-novak-djokovic-next-time-andrey-rublev-makes-honest-admission-after-2023-paris-masters-defeat
Cameraman wouldn't stop filming
Feel bad but he played like utter trash in the 2nd set. Looked completely checked out.
40 Masters 1000 and 400+ weeks at #1 incoming. Unstoppable. üêê
Nice, well rounded numbers , both 40+ and 400+ . Would look nice on his profile .
And 97th overall title üëÄ
Soon to be 100+. Novak is just a round number enthusiast that‚Äôs all
He wont say it, but I fully believe he will want to beat Connors' record before retiring.
If he wanted to do it earlier, he could have farmed 250s and 500s. But Novak only played them at the start of his career. Who‚Äôs to say he won‚Äôt play them towards the end, if the results are close.
Ruud gonna be in shambles when Novak starts showing up at his beloved clay 250s
Except he just said it lol.
The stats are staggering, especially when compared to Federer's.
At this point, it isn‚Äôt a question. Federer statistically is in another tier. The question is whether Novak can put Fed basically two tiers below Novak.
The difference between them is another all time great career. 4 GS + 12 Masters + 87 weeks at #1. That's basically Andy Murray minus the Olympic Golds.
We measuring tennis players' success in murrays now ü§£
Novak is currently 1 murray above Federer.
This sums it up pretty much when you put it like that ü§£
Really at this point Novak‚Äôs not competing against Fed or even Nadal by Gretzky, Jordan, etc.
even the most deluded Federer fans may finally realize that Djokovic is the greatest.
Tennis is a funny sport where players hit a ball back and forth across a net to win points and in the end, Novak Djokovic lifts trophies.
Yes very impressive and all but I‚Äôm already used to seeing Novak lifting trophies, I want to talk about how the man is fluent in SIX different languages üò≠üò≠üò≠
Serbian, English, French, Spanish, Italian. What am I missing?
German I guess.
More like Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Bunjevci, Montenegrin and English ;)
Paris crowd doesn't deserve the 3 set thriller final. Well done, Novak. Sincerely, Meddy fan
The only thing that crowd deserved was Novak going POPOPOPOPOLOLOL OLEEEE
Another day at the office for the goat
djokovic now 1490 points ahead of alcaraz all but secures YE no.1 and (400+ weeks at no.1) only way he losses it is for carlos to go 5-0 in turin and djokovic to go winless
I have a bigger chance of winning Turin myself than that happening ü§£
You have a higher chance of winning the doubles competition as a single player than that happening :)
Can Novak participate some small tournament meanwhile for 20pts he needs to secure position ?
There are 250s upcoming week, I am sure they would give wc to Novak but I doubt he is interested
Dude could fly into Bulgaria for a few hours, win a match, and then just go home
I don‚Äôt think Novak would ever do that, but it would be insanely funny ngl. He doesn‚Äôt even need to win a match I think, he has a bye in the 1st round üòÇ
Alcaraz will not reach the semis in Torino.
Tbh it's more likely that he doesn't than he does, imo djokovic, medvedev, sinner, zverev, rublev, rune are all either in better form and/or are just better players on indoor hard. And for Tsitipas if he is going to ever beat Alcaraz now is his best chance
John Titor in here, huh?
By the end of the year, Novak will be close to 3000 points ahead of Alcaraz. There might not be any competition for the #1 next year, even if Alcaraz wins Australia (unlikely anyway)
I am thinking more on the direction if he can get the gap to 2500 so that he doesn't lose it at AO.
The Goat doing goat things
üêê
70th major big title win!
Hang on what's a major big title? I know what a major is and he's not there yet haha
Grand Slams, Masters 1000, ATP Finals and Olympics 
Big titles. Aka, Slams, WTF, Masters, Olympics.
what's a major big title? 
Most matches were kinda tight... except the final
Tightovic
This tight Djokussy üòèüòàü§≠
What a motherfuckin GOAT. 40 masters and very likely 400 weeks and 8th YE1
I'll tell you where they're at, they're at the line of shame!
I almost feel bad for them. Can you imagine SOLELY watching tennis just on the 1% chance that the GOAT loses just so you can shit talk him when he has literally nothing left to prove? No loss in the world can take away his past wins anyway.
4 hundred weeks, so that's 8 years. that's amazing.
Surely we can round it to 416 to make it so heh
What to say.. i think nothing, lets all enjoy this greatness while it lasts
GOAT
The inevitable one.
congrats to nole on 40 masters. amazing week for him, further cementing this as the amazing season it is. lets also give grigor his flowers because bro has been on fire since the US open. i only watched his match against tsitsipas but he had a nightmare draw this tournament. beating Musetti, Medvedev, Bublik, Hurkacz, Tsitsipas, and THEN having to play djokovic for the title is TOUGH. he should be very proud of this weeks performance, no doubt
YE #1 and 400 weeks at #1
Hardly an amazing final, but a 40th Masters title is another unreal milestone for the GOAT. üèÜ
üêê doing üêê things! 40 Masters 1000 and 400+ weeks at No 1 ! Keep booing lol.
Grigor crying is killing me.
insane
The GOAT broke another string of records with that win. Phenomenal athlete. Kudos to Dimitrov, too- great week and last few months for him.
We are witnessing the outcome of having no other Big 3 members to challenge Novak, all the hypothetical "what if Novak had no Nadal or Fed?" arguments are being answered this year.
Them 2 really didn't challenge him much at slams anyway except for rg, they were just there to win them when he got taken out by someone else.
Federer hasn‚Äôt won against Novak at grandslam since 2012 üò≠that‚Äôs nut
Djokovic is the greatest athlete of all time
It‚Äôs inevitable
Probs to Djokovic, but man poor Dimitrov amazing week but just miss the last stretch, the important one
Heartbreaking for Dimitrov. Hope he gets another shot at the title
The üêêdoes what is required of the üêê: WIN, WIN AND WIN, undisputed champ in my eyes, now and for the unforeseeable future  üíØ
Well deserved. Not his highest level but always consistent and does enough to push through the boundaries
Couldn't have been happier with these 2 in the final (flair makes it obvious)
you gotta change your flair buddy. its FORTY now
Fun fact 6 titles in a season is most he had since 2016
What a Sunday it has been man, phew. Kohli's record tieing 100, India absolutely destroying South Africa and now Novak just extending his record to 40 masters. He now leads Carlos by 1490 pints, just 1 more win for Novak in Turin and that will be it. Absolutely fucking insane athlete.
And the second time he‚Äôs done the Paris double. The only other time anyone else has done this (just the once) is Agassi
is 400 weeks at #1 secured now?
needs to win one match in Turin to secure it
lets hope a week will be enought for him to recover before finals
He made the bigger gap on the history of the sport and now just keep making it larger and larger
I can imagine future goat level players matching Federer's numbers, and the conversation being, "He surpassed Federer, but there is no way he is catching Djokovic".
Novak Djokovic is Lawn Tennis father
Customary Luka Doncic is Devin Booker father
Victor Wembanyama is Kevin Durant  father
Mons. Djokovic wins the magnificent spiky brass tree lol
worst trophy of any tournament ngl
Did you see him slow up and figure how to kiss it :)
yeah haha it was like trying to kiss a cactus
This guy is actually unstoppable!!!
GOAT
This guy is just tooo tooo good. Even the most hardcore fans of Rafa (myself included) or Roger can not deny this, Novak is a different level that anyone else ever played this game.
Djokovic winning in this sleepwalk fashion only makes the rest of the tour look bad. Really seems like it‚Äôs all up to whether he‚Äôs playing well and when he does, no one comes close.
Djokovic's 40th masters title!!! 12 more than Federer. Federer is getting closer to Murray than he is to Djokovic. BIG ONE.
Hey OP, do you mind editing the picture to put the score? I‚Äôll leave this up as the post match thread since it was the first to say he won but it would be nice to have :)
unfortunately it can't be edited due to being image post. I should've created text post with an add on image so it could be edited. sorry :( keep your comment pinned at the top for the score
No problem! I get that Reddit is funky ü•≤
I don't follow anything tennis related, but why do people even play it, when this dude apparently wins everything?
Dread from him, RUN from him, Thanovic arrives all the time
All the same is the expression I believe
Well played and congratulations üéâ

Where is Goran?

And people still dumb enough to debate if he's the GOAT or not. Man is unreal.
He is inevitable.
here for r/tennis tears 
It must be hard for Djokovic haters these days huh.
Seeing how peak Dimitrov, Medvedev and Alcaraz are getting destroyed, I wonder if young Federer, Murray and Nadal would have a career if they started today.
Not too bad ehh ?
Remember when he got all the hate for not taking mRNA-based vaccines?
Feel bad for Dimitrov:(
No mercy in Bercy.
What are the conditions for Nole to end the year as No. 1 going into the ATP Finals?
Win one round robin match.
Either of:
85% upvotes lmao
That was one-sided. But was there ever really any doubt? Dimitrov was like his usual self.
Not the best Djokovic but it‚Äôs enough
Who was the huge dude during the trophy presentation?
Insane this guy sometimes, I wonder if there is any record left for him to achieve
I mean it‚Äôs just incredible. The goat debate for Novak is now at the professional sport level. It‚Äôs a tribute to willpower and staying power. Keep going Nole.
Djokovic üêê

The least surprising thing I saw today...!
These news are ‚Äúsame old, same old‚Äù‚Ä¶..
Someone please rise up and challenge him this is getting boring and tiresome 
This guy, Novak, reminds me of the dominance lance Armstrong displayed in the tour de France!!
Hooray.
LOOKED TOO EASY
6 more to go to match Federer's ATP singles titles & 12 more to go to match Jimmy Connors's ATP singles titles
Yawn / clap
Weak/no competiton
Ah the classic Nadal vs. Fed strategy lol
Including hitting unusually high heavy top to the Dimi backhand, not his normal shot trajectory, so must‚Äôve been part of his specific gameplan today.
Was never in doubt , odds of 1.01 easy
Next year Olympics in Paris hopefully
10th overall title in Paris. Not too bad
Saving one match point against Korda, and one against Carlos.
I have seen enough, Medvedev is the goat for giving this beast his only hardcourt loss
5 losses in this entire year: 1 on Hard, 3 on Clay and 1 on Grass. 
Yes the 100th reminder today
Insanity. Just amazing.
People were saying it was the end of Novak and was a "new era"(Nike openly stating this in their ad campaign) lol
Guess he showed Nike, it‚Äôs still the Novak era.
Alcaraz lit the fire and nole was more determined after that loss.
Meanwhile me, diarrhea at 32 and tied to my bed for 2 days

By the end of the year, Novak will be close to 3000 points ahead of Alcaraz. There might not be any competition for the #1 next year, even if Alcaraz wins Australia (unlikely anyway)
I am thinking more on the direction if he can get the gap to 2500 so that he doesn't lose it at AO.

All the same is the expression I believe
Stomach bug + didn't play in 6 weeks will do that. Hopefully he'll be at 100% for the Finals.
RemindMe! 736 days
Nope. Novak isn‚Äôt losing at WTF
That's a very good question for a press conference.
Undeniably at this point, although if you go on instagram there's still people who claim he isn't as loved as fedal therefore he isn't the goatüòÇ mental gymnastics...
Knee surgery
Lol
Win one round robin match.
Either of:
Teddy Riner, Judo world champion, multiple times, he was undefeated during 10 years if i remember correctly.
Federer has to win 4 more slams, 12 (lol) more masters, 90 more weeks at World number 1, and 3 more YE#1 to match Djokovic... lmao what a copium.
Loool
One of the least important statistics in tennis, considering he's playing masters whereas Connors and Fed played lots and lots of 250s/500s. Not saying its not an amazing achievement, but hitting 40 masters out of 97 titles is far more impressive.  
Don‚Äôt worry he will surpass those easy. He just said that himself today and he plans on playing for many more years
He could just play 250s for a year and easily surpass both of those.  Instead, he chooses to play challenging tournaments.
It's just the most effective strategy against the 1hbh no matter what its apologists try to argue: it's a liability every time you face a same-peer opponent.
He really REALLY  wants Olympic gold.
Meh. That's giving the Olympics too much undeserved attention imo. At least until they are best of 5.
I belive in that
Olympic and Monte Carlo to became only with at least 3 titles from each Masters tournament.
That is all we can hope for.
Both championship points as well
Yeah it took a resurgence hard-court beast like Meddie to took Novak out.
Seethe
‚ÄúPassing of the torch‚Äù lmao
Wimbledon final was an uncharacteristic performance from novak, he looked a bit like a "mental midget", the wind really seems to get to him lmao. Make no mistake though this man is still imperious and I think the only thing that will stop him is father time.
Which was always bullshit because the general level of tennis is so, so much higher than 10 years ago it is incomparable.
I remember all the Fedal fans in the post match thread crowing about how "Novak's weak era farming is over and he'll never win anything again"
With respect, when you take a longer look at eras, it was a symbolic win.
Nike is a bitch ass, child labor company, remember the ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù ad with Rafa, the passing of the torch with Alcaraz ‚Ä¶. Hahaha they are bitter as fuck for Nole rejecting them a bunch of times.
Same though üò≠ people on Twitter were complaining that Djokovic took a bathroom break after the second set against Rublev‚Ä¶ Like, did they forget the guy is playing with a bad stomach
source please?
Tomorrow bad he‚Äôs gonna have over 50 masters titles when all is said and done üòÅ
Soon to be 100+. Novak is just a round number enthusiast that‚Äôs all
At this point, it isn‚Äôt a question. Federer statistically is in another tier. The question is whether Novak can put Fed basically two tiers below Novak.
even the most deluded Federer fans may finally realize that Djokovic is the greatest.
German I guess.
More like Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Bunjevci, Montenegrin and English ;)
You have a higher chance of winning the doubles competition as a single player than that happening :)
There are 250s upcoming week, I am sure they would give wc to Novak but I doubt he is interested
Tbh it's more likely that he doesn't than he does, imo djokovic, medvedev, sinner, zverev, rublev, rune are all either in better form and/or are just better players on indoor hard. And for Tsitipas if he is going to ever beat Alcaraz now is his best chance
John Titor in here, huh?
He probably is working hard just not to lose all of his matches, he is the weakest link in Turin right now.
Grand Slams, Masters 1000, ATP Finals and Olympics 
Big titles. Aka, Slams, WTF, Masters, Olympics.
what's a major big title? 
This tight Djokussy üòèüòàü§≠
I almost feel bad for them. Can you imagine SOLELY watching tennis just on the 1% chance that the GOAT loses just so you can shit talk him when he has literally nothing left to prove? No loss in the world can take away his past wins anyway.
Surely we can round it to 416 to make it so heh
Federer hasn‚Äôt won against Novak at grandslam since 2012 üò≠that‚Äôs nut
I GOT'CHU FAM
Sony Ten 2 on dth tv.
No, 400 weeks is secured and guaranteed now but he needs one win in Turin to secure year end number 1 or Carlos to lose at least one match in Turin.
Victor Wembanyama is Kevin Durant  father
Jokic is a father of 3: Embiid, Lebron and AD
Did you see him slow up and figure how to kiss it :)
unfortunately it can't be edited due to being image post. I should've created text post with an add on image so it could be edited. sorry :( keep your comment pinned at the top for the score
That‚Äôs the closest competition still. The only right ones to compare with. Take it as a compliment. You seem very insecure about their records being broken though. It‚Äôs okay buddy
Only the insecure ones
I will be messaging you in 2 years on 2025-11-10 19:21:31 UTC to remind you of this link
Would he not lose points if he fails to defend the title?
Thank you! I knew he didn‚Äôt look like a tennis playerü§£
Played with strong one handers like Wawrinka or Thiem or Gasquet (despite his other shortcomings) have no trouble with it.
I wonder if the pressure gets to him, I mean he‚Äôs played in 4 Olympic Games now, all of them narrow misses. He‚Äôs won everything now, I wonder if that pressure is only existing in the Olympics
It means so much to him and for everyone in Serbia because we all know how much he wants to win it.
Well novak is definitely giving it a lot of  importance, although I do dislike that they changed the final from best of 5 that was cool.
Easy best of all time stuff
Novak passed the torch from his right hand to his left hand.
People really thought he was done after that lmfao.
A note to add. It was just Nike doing its thing, when Alcaraz was asked about the start of his era he clearly answered that No era is starting until Novak and Rafa retire. 
I don‚Äôt know who claimed it was the passing of the torch. Because as far as i remember Novak was the favourite to win both Cincy and USO
It was 100% the wind, Alcaraz, while he played great, was super lucky the roof happened to be open on that day (was raining like 3 days in a row prior). 
Absolutely, I thought he had it on the 5th set and gave it away!
You think the level of tennis now is ‚Äúincomparably higher‚Äù now than it was in 2012-2013?? What are you talking about?
They all use child labor. Most produced products do
Imagine thinking a company is ‚Äúbitter‚Äù.
Exactly. I think the man has earned the right to take a mid match dump lol
https://tennisuptodate.com/atp/i-dont-want-to-play-novak-djokovic-next-time-andrey-rublev-makes-honest-admission-after-2023-paris-masters-defeat
He wont say it, but I fully believe he will want to beat Connors' record before retiring.
So if everything goes right his 98th will be Finals, 99 a 250 in Aus and 100th at the Australian Open.
The difference between them is another all time great career. 4 GS + 12 Masters + 87 weeks at #1. That's basically Andy Murray minus the Olympic Golds.
Djokovic is unequivocally the greatest tennis player of all time, but LMFAO at Federer being "another tier" below Novak. I mean... that's just not true at all...
Dude could fly into Bulgaria for a few hours, win a match, and then just go home
Ah I see gotcha, never heard of that before but I like it
Thanks a lot!
Nope. He's got 397 now. Next week will be 398. The one after that (the one of the finals) will be 399. If Alcaraz passes him there his streak ends and he doesn't get to 400.
yeah haha it was like trying to kiss a cactus
No problem! I get that Reddit is funky ü•≤
Nah nole stans are insecure cause deep down they know nadal and fed peak is something novak will never come close to.  Third tier goat only has numbers.  Tennis of the gods is fed and rafa.  Novak was always third man out until fed and rafa got bored and moved on with their lives.
Lol this sub is def in a state when op is getting big upvotes for trashing on retired fed for...reasons?
Good bot
He has enough of a margin over Carlos. Of course if he does even better in Turin his lead over Carlos can just grow coming into the new year.
Points are already deducted, and for YE#1 you want to look at the "Live Race," not Live Ranking.
In short, all earned points last 1 year. So in the end of the year, only points from this year still last to be counted. So, all points won last year including points from Masters Finals 2022 become irelevand (nonexistant).
Nadal is a specialist of the shot and he's made a mockery of both wawrinka and gasquet, as well as exploiting Federer's backhand for years.
He won't lose it this rime around. Every single player on the tour is terrified of him, he just needs to show up.
I understand that you pour certain value in it, but objectively, Novak is already the best and the fact that he doesn't have an Olympic gold to prove it just shows what a bad representation the Olympics are when it comes to tennis. They are constructed in a way that rewards luck more than anything.
Yeah. Both players already have a guaranteed medal. At least fight a bit harder for the better one.
Not THAT easy, but yeah... Up there. He's a beast!
He would probably still win with his left hand
If you went by some people's comments, you'd think Alcaraz straight setted him with bagels and breadsticks instead of just barely getting the win in an insanely competitive match.
To be fair, I think Alcaraz is brilliant and my comment wasn‚Äôt a knock on him, more just on the narrative on here and social media after that match
Novak will take Wimbledon back next year, his revenge tour against the kids won't stop until he gets all 4 Gs at the same time plus the olympic Gold. Then, perhaps, he might not win something but still will be in the finals.
I disagree, if he wins Wimbledon, the pressure to win USO to complete the CYGS would have been stifling. Personally I preferred Novak losing Wimbledon and winning USO to complete his revenge tour.
I love Novak as much as anybody else but to say it was 100% wind and Carlos was just lucky is just bollocks. Yes, Novak came ridiculously close to basically sealing the win in that tiebreak but he didn't.
Are you fr? Wimbledon is an outdoor tournament. Give Credit where it's due.
I am sorry to say this but its because of people like you that Novak fans get the bad reputation that they do. Give credit where its due without the excuses. There are no if and buts in tennis.
Companies are run by people
If he wanted to do it earlier, he could have farmed 250s and 500s. But Novak only played them at the start of his career. Who‚Äôs to say he won‚Äôt play them towards the end, if the results are close.
Except he just said it lol.
We measuring tennis players' success in murrays now ü§£
This sums it up pretty much when you put it like that ü§£
Really at this point Novak‚Äôs not competing against Fed or even Nadal by Gretzky, Jordan, etc.
As people point out below, the difference between the two is Andy Murray‚Äôs career. Seems like another tier to me.
I don‚Äôt think Novak would ever do that, but it would be insanely funny ngl. He doesn‚Äôt even need to win a match I think, he has a bye in the 1st round üòÇ
Happy to help üòé
No mate, you‚Äôre wrong üòÇ
I was with you in your original comment. OP Doucane didn't need to mention Federer at all, it was an unnecessary dig. But you're quite the insecure and delusional fan yourself. Novak's peak IS Tennis' peak arguably and to say he doesn't even come close to Fedal's peak is just next level crazy if I'm being honest.
they know nadal and fed peak is something novak will never come close to
Come on dude. I am fedal fan too but whatever you just said is absolute BS.
only has numbers.
What kind of mental gymnastics do you have to do to get around the fact that Novak was schooling both of them in their prime?
I understand why but its unnecessary
Thank you, didigetintomedschool, for voting on RemindMeBot.
They said that in 2021 and 2016
Like Wimbledon?? üòù
I agree. But that is the only thing he haven't won yet plus it is unique experience, he gets to play once in 4 years for his country. He is already undispited GOAT but, he does not need it for his GOAT status.
It's the only thing he hasn't won
Lmao Novak after going down two sets in next years Wimby final - "There is something you should know: I am not right handed."
Yeah I saw all of that. Got a lot of updoots on those too.
True lol. The level Alcarez got to in those 3 sets he won was probably best he's played all year as well, he wasn't going to be able to sustain that form.
Bagels would've been less concerning. Would just mean that Novak had a terrible day. On the other hand, losing a grueling five-setter after winning the first set and having a set point in the second has more weight
Maybe we should ignore social media and their claims because according to them Shelton could win US open. Everyone on social media pretends to be a tennis expert.
I don't think so because he's already had the experience of going for the CYGS in 2021. With that experience I think it wouldn't get to his head. It's also somewhat similar to getting #23 and finally passing Fedal, that's also insane pressure but he did it. 
Did I say "100%"? I clearly said Alcaraz played great but I'd confidently bet he'd lose had the roof been closed because Novak is a much better player without the wind hindering him, it's night and day. On top of that, Alcaraz is a much worse player indoors as we've just seen. Even with the wind he was 1 point off from going 2-0 in sets which is an almost guaranteed win (Alcaraz said this himself btw).
He gets credit for it, yet at the same time he was also still lucky that out of the 90% of the days it was raining, it wasn't raining on that particular day because Novak is much better indoors and Carlos is much worse. Both of these things can be true.
The credit was me saying he still played great, keep up. Talking hypotheticals is just a fun thing in sports and some of you clowns take it so seriously like it's blasphemy, it's just talk. If the margin for his win were THIS small on the worst conditions for Novak and the best conditions for him, I truly believe that indoors Alcaraz wouldn't have stood a chance. 
Ruud gonna be in shambles when Novak starts showing up at his beloved clay 250s
He did? Haha thats funny.  Was it in an interview after the tournament or something?
Novak is currently 1 murray above Federer.
Nah. You're wrong. That tweet doesn't say anywhere that he's guaranteed 400 weeks. It says he'll have 398 on November 6 which is tomorrow and is indeed the start of his 398th week as no.1. The week after that is the finals and will be his 399th. No guarantees beyond that.
OP Doucane didn't need to mention Federer at all, it was an unnecessary dig
Tennis Talent (accurate Scale)
After 2009 fed and nadal were pretty much done rest is gravy.
Come back to 2009 with me, it is pure and just.
I usually try to go for the civil debate and ask you and your buddy over here for arguments to back up whatever claims you might have. But in this case i'm gonna go for something i rarely do; Go cry some more. You have eachother to work thru this.
He will take Wimbledon back next year.
It has more weight to prove that it was essentially a coin toss and not a passing of the torch.
he wouldn't have had the fairly easy draw if he was seeded no 1 for the uso after winning wimby. Still a good chance he wins
4 of each. Yes please.
maybe I am stupid but I interpreted "it was 100% the wind" to mean "it was 100% the wind"
Did I say "100%"?
He didn‚Äôt win it though did he, and he will never win Wimbledon 2023 so get your ridiculous cope salt out of your garbage tier ‚Äòarguments‚Äô.
Indoor grass is not the same as Indoor hard, we don't have definite data to conclude that. Also, I mean, with a player of Novak's stature, him playing bad at a Wimbledon Final is his responsibility, it's not an excuse, and Novak himself wouldn't give that excuse. Every match Novak plays against Alcaraz is where Novak shows how seriously he takes Alcaraz.
Can you admit Novak was lucky to play Nadal with the roof closed at Wimby 2018 then?
I was being polite to you and you just called me a clown. Thank you for proving my point. You can keep ranting now.
In an interview there was a post on here. Just a sec.
Does he need to win Turin for 406? Or is 1 match win with Alcaraz going 5-0 good enough for 406?
Ah, my mistake involving in this conversation. Carry on.
You are not a real person üíÄü§£
How is that relevant to your statement that Novak didn't have the higher peak of the three?  
Both nadal and federer were at the peak of their physical form in those years, nadal was 24 ffs. If you are saying they were declining before even hitting 30 that's kind of their fault
Whoosh
Of course it was a coin toss, but knowing that Djokovic is only gonna get worse and Alcaraz better, it's not difficult to see why people were saying these things. It was delusional to think that suddenly Djokovic was never going to win anything ever again after that match, but in future, depending on how the next two seasons play out, it maybe will have been considered as a sort of a turning point in tennis history indeed
100% the difference, not the only factor because he still had a chance to beat Alcaraz outdoors... If it was closed that difference wouldn't be there and Novak likely wins.
100% he wouldn't lose if the roof was closed. He still had a chance to win with the wind and at the same time Alcaraz played great to win but it was a huge advantage for him no doubt.
Why so salty bb
Look, I get you're butthurt about him just winning his 40th Masters and winning 3/4 Slams, being #1 at 36, all this over a 20 year old prodigy. The only salt mine here are people like you. Trust me, literally not a single Novak fan is "salty" or "coping" over this amazing season because of 1 loss lmao. It's just a hypothetical, it's what people do when talking about sports, get your garbage tier comments out of here instead.
It's not the same but Novak prefers calm conditions where he can be as precise as possible so indoor is always a plus. It also speeds up the court which doesn't help Alcaraz. He didn't play bad, he just got hindered enough by the wind where it was a clear advantage for Alcaraz. This is just me stating a fact, no one can say indoor wouldn't have favored him more.
Sure, anyone who has a favorable weather/roof outcome had luck on their side. The difference is Djokovic is objectively a much better grass court player than Nadal so it's arguable if it would have made much of a difference, especially if there was no wind and it was sunny. 
You're being polite by saying people like me make all Novak fans have a bad reputation because I'm talking about a fun hypothetical? Are you joking, trolling or do you have short term memory loss? That's more offensive than me calling you a clown lmao.
He just needs to keep no. 1 after Turin. Doesn't matter how. If he does he's got a guaranteed 406 weeks at number one because there are no more (ranked) tournaments until the first week of next year. The first chance for a change in rankings after Turin is on January 8th.
They weren't declining they just realized they had achieved peak tennis and decided to start doing other fun things like watch commercials and yachting and other chad stuff.  They are based.  Nole is literally an anti-vax truther with anger issues (see olympics, net post smashing in wimb, hitting poor lineswoman at USO) who seems to get his advice from a naturapath "guru" unless you know ...he has actual problems like the one time he needed elbow surgery.  Then modern medicine was fine. :)
Yeah but it wasn't lol. The true turning point will be when Novak stops making Finals consistently.
Hypotheticals are hypotheticals. There's no ifs and buts in sports other than being a coping mechanism of some sort.
It would've but by the same logic Carlos not cramping against Novak at RG would've favoured him more as well. There are a lot of factors that decide the outcome of a Tennis match, on that I agree with you, but the results often paint the best picture.
I was reading an article about it and supposedly it was very warm that day which would have favored Nadal since he prefers higher bouncing conditions. Novak was barely coming back into form so he wasn‚Äôt at full strength yet during that match.
Its because of some people like you that the entire fan base has got this reputation. Its very unfortunate. I love Novak but you are insufferable.
Ah okay, you are actually just a crazy person. Nevermind my previous comments, there's no talking to you
It's literally just sports talk, and hypotheticals are a big part of that, win or lose, it's not always a coping mechanism lol... I could freely hypothetically talk about Federer having a proper serve at 40-15 on any of those 3 occasions because he could have easily won, even if I didn't want him to. At the end it's just talk, it's been several months already, no one is seriously and unironically coping that far away in the future.
I mean, cramping is solely based on improper preparation and letting nerves get to you so that was 100% in his control. As opposed to the roof being open which is in the control of the weather gods, so can't make such comparisons.
