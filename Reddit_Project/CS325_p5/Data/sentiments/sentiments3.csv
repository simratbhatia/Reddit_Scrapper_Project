"The iPhone 15 pro max is the worst iPhone from the past 5 years no iphone has had as many problems so soon after launch.   theres screen burn in, overheating, fragile back glass and the battery life is worse then its predecessor.   The 15 pro doesn't have the fragile glass or overheating in my experience and the 15 and 15 plus dont have any major issue's.  Do you guys agree?",Negative
You know OP this is not Twitter. You wont get paid for negative viral posts here.,Neutral.
"It might not be Twitter, but my phone hit the shitter recently and itâ€™s nice to hear other peopleâ€™s experiences with phones that just came out.",The sentiment is nostalgic.
No. I donâ€™t agree. But thatâ€™s cool you think 15PM is bad I guess. Weâ€™ve all got a few bad opinions.,Neutral
"Apple fixed issues in a matter of days weeks the most while Samsung and other companies have issues on their phones for years and get away with it without being newsâ€¦.pixel just fixed the broken portrait mode theyâ€™ve had for years on their phones with a new phone release ignoring the old ones that couldâ€™ve been fixed with software for exampleâ€¦Samsung puts a fake moon when you take a foto if it and most people ignore it, if Apple did these things all hell would break looseâ€¦.im perfectly happy with my 15 pro max absolutely NO issues!! This is being blown out of proportion",The sentiment of this statement is positive. The author is expressing happiness with their iPhone and criticizing other companies for their lack of responsiveness in fixing bugs and issues.
Serious question: why does Apple get shit on the most when they resolve their issues immediately?? How do the Android people defend this?,The sentiment of this statement is confusion.
"Bashing Apple gives clicks on videos, itâ€™s incredible how quick they fixed the 15 pro maxâ€™s issues, I actually like that they are treated like this because it makes them fix their shit quick and get it all together, other brands have issues and they just mostly ignore it for months because itâ€™s not news worthy, many issues about Samsung and pixel phones are not even mentioned on videos yet Apple is right away 1st page thatâ€™s all you see, and how they switched from all to android, how they returned their iPhones after one month, itâ€™s all for clicks","The sentiment in this statement is positive. The speaker is praising Apple for being quick to fix issues and for being popular enough to be covered in the news. They are also praising Apple for their customer service, implying that other brands are less responsive"
"yeah, very true. it's bandwagoning. it's easy to shit on apple. don't get me wrong, they have their flaws, but hearing how pixel and Samsung takes months, even up to YEARS, is wild. Apple does focus on long-term service, and that's why it has such a strong following.",The sentiment of this statement is generally positive towards Apple.
Iâ€™ve had the 15 Pro Max since launch and I havenâ€™t had any issues that have made headlines. Your mileage may vary.,Positive
You're just regurgitating Reddit headlines.,Negative.
"There have been issues with iPhones every year and most of them are resolved not long after launch. I and many others feel the 15 Pro Max is an excellent iPhone and for me may be the best ever! Excellent cameras, display, battery life etc. the issues are far and few between and itâ€™s not hard to find the numerous posts of others very happy with their phone.",The sentiment in this statement is generally positive.
This,Neutral
"I can assure you, the iPhone 13 Pro Max did not had nearly as much issues as the 15 Pro Max.",Positive
Most of the issues are software based and already been resolved.,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
iâ€™m coming out of a 13 pro max and wish I never got this and got rid of the 13,Negative.
You basically listed all software issues. Forcing a bend to break it doesnâ€™t feel like a legitimate concernâ€¦ I donâ€™t recall trying to break a phone beforeâ€¦ but if social media told you to be angry sure okâ€¦ knowing there were issues with the iOS I switched cleanâ€¦ no restoring no nothingâ€¦ update to latest iOS and factory reset and went in cleanâ€¦ no issues here.,The sentiment of the statement is neutral.
not to mention the guy who snapped it has the biggest hard on for apple of any youtube who has ever you tubed,Negative.
And no one else was able to replicate his results lmao. I watched tonnes of vids and none of them could break the back glass by bending it with their hands.,This sentiment is mocking and/or amused.
"15PM since launch day, such an unbelievably great phone. The titanium build has made the phone lighter than I thought it could be. The battery literally lasts me from 6am to 12am with moderate to heavy usage daily, and the camera has been stellar. The phone is so polished itâ€™s easy to forget how snappy the UI on iOS17 is as well. Just so many crazy great things from it.",The sentiment of this statement is highly positive.
This is certainly an opinion,The sentiment of this statement is subjective.
In your experience the 15 pro doesnâ€™t have these problems but NOT in your experience the 15 pro max is the worst phone ever? I wish people who make these comments would have actually owned the phone and reported their actual findings and not constantly regurgitating stupid headlines from other people.,The sentiment of this comment is one of frustration.
I went from Z Fold 4 to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I love the 15PM and so far I have not seen a problem yet. I love this natural titanium color,Positive
This is a shopping list of those who have never tried it in their hands,Neutral
Do you even own this phone?,Neutral
Sounds like a broke mf,Negative
lol you think people who dont have this kind of tech are broke?,Neutral.
Nope I have the 15 pro my dad has the 15 pro max and has had overheating problems but no screen burn in yet.,Neutral
"So you dont own it, dont use it everyday, but that is the worst phone in your opinion. Overheating is fixed with the last update.",Neutral.
You forgot to mention that phone isnâ€™t even experiencing issues anymore ðŸ˜‚.,The sentiment of this statement could be interpreted as amusement.
I have a 15 pro max and have had EVERY problem so far.  itâ€™s only been a week,Negative
I'm calling it.,The sentiment is determined/final.
4 years*,Neutral
Worst?,Negative.
Word.,Neutral.
"I've got the 15 Pro, no issues at all. Although I do wish it was more like a Pixel than an iPhone. A Pixel with iMessage, warmer photos and just being actually reliable would be nice. But I use Beeper for iMessage and I can always edit my photos",The overall sentiment of this statement is neutral.
I have always been a Samsung guy. I recently bought the 15 pro max (keeping both) . Havenâ€™t had one issue with the iPhone.  Battery last almost 18 hours and hasnâ€™t gotten hot at all. Have not seen any burn in.,Positive
"I guess I agree. Of course, weâ€™re looking at the phones only during their respective years in which they launched. So yes, I would say the 15 is probably the worst.",Neutral
Overheating was corrected with the a software update and how strong do you want a giant slab of glass be?,Neutral.

My 15 pro max still kind of overheat after playing a bit with the camera or apps. Battery not that great compared to my previous s23 ultra. Hope for 17.1 to provide improvements..,Negative
